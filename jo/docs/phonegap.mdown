PhoneGap
========

This excellent, lightweight mobile application library by [Nitobi](http://phonegap.com)
neutralizes device differences and provides a stable webkit application shell. Jo is
designed to work with PhoneGap out of the box, and it's highly recommended.

LawnChair
=========

Another tool by [Nitobi](http://phonegap.com), LawnChair is a client-side storage
solution which stores JSON objects (in SQLite or whatever the device supports). It looks
promising, and the jo core has a special subclass of joDataSource called joLawn
which folds Nitobi's library into the Jo event model.
